                    <p>At just 18, Mohamed Rafeek opened his dream Asian restaurant in 2024, inspired by his grandmother’s recipes. Growing up in a small town, he spent years helping her cook dumplings, stir-fries, and ramen. With his savings, passion, and a small loan, he transformed a cozy corner space into "Asian Restaurant." . Social media buzzed, drawing in food lovers eager for unique flavors. Despite doubts about his age, Rafeek's dedication and authenticity won hearts. By year’s end, "Asian Restaurant" became the town’s favorite spot, proving dreams have no age.</p>
